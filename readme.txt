== Description ==

MailDepot is created to help increase email signups by letting visitors who want to download a file (PDF, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, TXT, ZIP, RAR) from your website subscribe to a Mailchimp email list first. 

The idea is to promote a lead-magnet such as an ebook, cheatsheet, or checklist for example and embed a download link directly into your post or page. This way, visitors can click on the download link, get a popup to opt-in to your Mailchimp list, and download the file immediately after they subscribe.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/MailDepot` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings -> MailDepot screen to configure the plugin
4. Enter your MailChimp API and hit enter. That will bring up a dropdown menu of your email lists.
5. Select the list you want to use.
6. Add the shortcode to your posts or pages. Shortcode example: [maildepot file='http://www.yoursite.com/test.pdf']
